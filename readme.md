Hello and welcome to DTC-Code.com! I'm the founder and principal author here, a seasoned car repair mechanic with over a decade of hands-on experience in diagnosing and fixing a wide range of automotive issues. With a passion for cars and a knack for problem-solving, I've dedicated my career to understanding the intricacies of vehicle maintenance and repair.

My Journey in the Automotive World

My love for cars began as a child, tinkering with engines in my family's garage. This early interest evolved into a professional pursuit when I enrolled in an automotive technology program after high school. Over the years, I've worked in various capacities within the automotive industry – from a junior mechanic in a local garage to a lead technician in a well-known dealership. This journey has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of both old-school mechanical systems and the latest automotive technologies.

Expertise in Diagnostics and Repair

Specializing in diagnostic troubleshooting, I've become proficient in interpreting Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) and using On-Board Diagnostics II (OBD2) systems. My expertise lies in not just reading codes, but in understanding the underlying issues and how they affect the vehicle's performance. This deep dive into automotive diagnostics has allowed me to successfully resolve complex mechanical and electrical problems in a wide range of vehicle makes and models.
